# Apply Platform
## A proof of concept for a secure application platform that uses verification of records to improve the reliability of the application process.
### Advantages of the platform 
* Uses advanced security concepts like AES, RSA and security protocols such as Kerberos and secret sharing to secure user data.
* User information is parsed in the client side browser and only encrypted data is sent over communication lines.
* Protocols are put in place to prevent violation of access by the various levels of access.

### Further development
* Replacing slower encryption protocols with more secure and faster algorithms.
* Further securing client server communication with AES.

## Applications
* Any application system for example job or university application system which uses verification of records.

## Specifics
* Developed on Ruby on Rails
